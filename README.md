So....


1. Will start with basic world gen, maybe 4 blocks.
2. Terminal at starting location is primary interaction with the "time machine"
3. Is a connection to the best llm, maybe we have to use chatgpt4, and from here we can have the nexus for learning vocab, sentences, and maybe some "print" function
4. Basic game goal is to fix the machine, but there are multiple endings
5. We want to motivate the user to learn, we want to reward them for learning, and we want it to be such that they don't just open their own chatgpt in a second window
6. I think a way to track progress, will be a big piece
7. I think some sort of language grading/testing to give some unoffficial language level. Can also be useful
8. Will want the interaction with the terminal/time machine to be interesting. 


-----

Create user class
Create basic class that just builds simple world --> transition to json config or other config language based world construction. 
create terminal in main poi. 
Integration of an llm is probably easiest with chatgpt4 per now, and we can dedicate maybe 50 euro for this purpose for now.
